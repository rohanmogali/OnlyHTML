        Knowing the status and accreditation of the college or institute is one of the foremost concerns of the
        admission seeker. It is important to know the kinds of universities, their status and degrees conferred by the
        education institutes. <br><br>
        There are different kinds of Universities which offer Engineering degree namely,<br><br>
        <strong>1.Central Universities</strong> <br>
        A central university is established by an Act of Parliament and are under the direct purview of the Department
        of Higher Education (DHE) under Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). <br><br>
        <strong>2.State Universities</strong> <br>
        As the name suggests, state universities are established, run and funded by the state government. State
        universities are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. <br><br>
        <strong>3.Deemed to be Universities</strong> <br>
        “Deemed” is a status of autonomy granted to a university by DHE under MHRD, on the advice of UGC. Deemed to be
        Universities enjoy full autonomy or independence in deciding courses, syllabus, admissions and fees. Some Deemed
        to be Universities can also grant degrees on their own. Deemed-to-be Universities, which continue to perform
        well, can get the status of a full-fledged University. <br><br>
        <strong>4.Private Universities</strong> <br>
        Private universities are also UGC approved institutes. However, such universities do not run on central or state
        funds. They can grant degrees but cannot have off-campus colleges or affiliate an institution/college. The
        Private universities need to adhere to UGC rules and regulations for operations. The UGC regularly sends
        committees to inspect Private universities. <br><br>

        <strong>Why most of the engineering colleges plan curriculum for 4 years?</strong>
       
        <br> <br>
        The possible answer to this question might be that sooner the completion of degree, lesser will be the
        competition for jobs. Hence the person can get exposure to jobs, industries and market at the earliest. <br>
        But Why 4 years??<br><br>
        1.Foremost reason could be because of the structure followed since all times.
        First year of the engineering degree is dedicated to study basics, which is common for all the students
        irrespective of the branch chosen.
        Second year is for core subjects of the branch chosen.
        Third year is for the study of elective subjects opted by student.
        Fourth year is for application where the theoretical knowledge is applied to real-time projects, internship
        offers and placements. <br><br>
        2.The next possible reason could be rather than taking the degree for 5 years, maybe you can finish in 4 years
        by taking a bit of high load during each semester and additional classes in summers. <br><br>
        3.Also, other possible reason could be that, to cover entire syllabus of engineering irrespective of the branch
        opted, it may take minimum of 4 years. Thus, engineering degree is for 4 years.
        4. Also keeping in mind with Business perspective ,one can say that 4 years of study is optimal to study which
        profits Institution and also do not burden up students with both study and fees. <br><br>
        5. One possible interesting and kind of funny reason could be following others.
        Somewhere someone has structured it for 4 years according to his/her convenance , and rest of them followed it. <br><br>

    <p style=" font-size: 25px; padding: 70px 120px;">
        After discussing all possible reasons, if you still think engineering could be extended up to 5 or 6 years, then you should also know when to opt for 5/6 years of engineering and what is the impact of studying for 5/6 years instead of 4 years.
